This is my school GitHub account, which I use to store and manage code for coursework related to my A.A.S. in Computer Programming & Development at Wake Tech.
This repository will hold assignments, exercises, and projects completed for class. It is intended to demonstrate my learning progress and provide a centralized place for my academic code submissions.

# About Me
## My Interests
I am currently focused on learning web development and data structures as a QA Analyst II, looking to transition into a junior developer role. Outside my studies, I enjoy spending time with my family, playing video games, working on car projects/motorcycles, and playing with my dogs.
## Websites I Recommend 
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - This is where I host my code and collaborate on projects. It's an essential tool for any programmer.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - A fantastic resource for finding answers to coding questions and learning from the community.
