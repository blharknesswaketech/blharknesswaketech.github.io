This is my school GitHub account, which I use to store and manage code for coursework related to my A.A.S. in Computer Programming & Development at Wake Tech.
This repository will hold assignments, exercises, and projects completed for class. It is intended to demonstrate my learning progress and provide a centralized place for my academic code submissions.
